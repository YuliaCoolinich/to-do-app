## ToDo list

Created a component that meets the requirements below:

+ Adding a new record.
+ A new record is added if its length is less than or equal to N characters.
+ Display a list of added records.
+ Switching the status of a record Completed / Not completed when clicking on its name.
+ Filtering by type (all, completed, current).
+ Display counter of completed and uncompleted tasks.
+ Used a storage (Redux).
+ For styling used [MUI framework](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/), but remember UI matters.
